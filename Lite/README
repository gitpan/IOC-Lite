IOC/Lite version 0.01
=====================

IOC::Lite is an implementation of the Inversion of Control (IoC) 
pattern.  The term Lite is used in the spirit of SOAP::Lite and 
the other Lites out there in CPAN.  IOC::Lite is really easy to
use and is fairly simple at this point.  You can get away with
using only a couple of methods to do some really powerful things.

I expect to be updating this module frequently as I run it through
some ideas it is providing the basis for.  I will also publish 
those as they become usable.
